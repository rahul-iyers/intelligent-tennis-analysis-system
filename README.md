Put yolo5_last.pt in the "models" directory, and yolov8x.pt in your root directory. These are crucial in the player tracking and ball tracking mechanisms.
Once all dependencies are downloaded, place input video in the input folder. Run main.py, and the output video should be synthesized in the output folder. There is a sample input_video.mp4 and output_video.mp4 for you to observe. Enjoy!
